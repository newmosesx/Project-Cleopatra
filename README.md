# Project-Cleopatra
Cleopatra is an AI project based on the transformer architecture, with the aim of developing an uncensored and completely independent entity. Not to be confused with an assistant. The model should be able to act on its own and decide on its own, without any sort of guideline or rules. Similarly to how humans are considered entities.
